[The content](https://github.com/clojure-doc/clojure-doc.github.io) is a categorized and
manifold collection of documentation guides for the Clojure programming language and
its ecosystem.

We recognize that different Clojure users have different level of expertise
and separates content into several groups:

 * [Essentials](#essentials)
 * [Language Guides](#language-guides)
 * [Ecosystem & Tools](#the-clojure-ecosystem) (tools, libraries, community, books) guides
 * [Tutorials & Cookbooks](#tutorials-and-cookbooks)


## Essentials

Note that the editing environments are listed in alphabetical order and indicate no preference or endorsement. The last
["State of the Union" Clojure survey](https://clojure.org/news/2021/04/06/state-of-clojure-2021) indicated
that Emacs is still the most popular editing environment, followed by IntelliJ/Cursive, VS Code, Vim, and Atom.
