This guide covers building a simple web-application using common
Clojure libraries. When you're done working through it, you'll have a
little webapp that displays some (x, y) locations from a database,
letting you add more locations as well.

It's assumed that you're already somewhat familiar with Clojure. If
not, see the [Getting Started](getting_started/) and
[Introduction](introduction/) guides.

This guide uses Clojure 1.5, as well as current versions of the
component libraries noted below.



## Conceptual Overview of Components

We'll use four major components (briefly described below) for our
little webapp:

  * Ring
  * Compojure
  * Hiccup
  * H2



### Ring

[Ring](https://github.com/ring-clojure/ring) ([at
clojars](https://clojars.org/ring)) is a foundational Clojure web
application library. It:

  * sets things up such that an http request comes into your webapp
    as a regular Clojure hashmap, and likewise makes it so that you
    can return a response as a hashmap.
  * provides [a
    spec](https://github.com/ring-clojure/ring/blob/master/SPEC)
    describing exactly what those request and response maps should
    look like.
  * brings along a web server
    ([Jetty](http://www.eclipse.org/jetty/)) and connects your
    webapp to it.

For this tutorial, we won't actually need to deal with these maps
by-hand, as you'll soon see.

For more info, see:

  * [the Ring readme](https://github.com/ring-clojure/ring#readme)
  * [its wiki docs](https://github.com/ring-clojure/ring/wiki)
  * [its API docs](http://ring-clojure.github.com/ring/)



### Compojure

If we were using only Ring, we'd have to write one single function to
take that incoming request map and then delegate to various functions
depending upon which page was requested.
[Compojure](https://github.com/weavejester/compojure) ([at
clojars](https://clojars.org/compojure)) provides some handy features
to take care of this for us such that we can associate url paths with
corresponding functions, all in one place.

For more info, see:

  * [the Compojure readme](https://github.com/weavejester/compojure#readme)
  * [its wiki docs](https://github.com/weavejester/compojure/wiki)
  * [its API docs](http://weavejester.github.com/compojure/)



### Hiccup

[Hiccup](https://github.com/weavejester/hiccup) ([at
clojars](https://clojars.org/hiccup)) provides a quick and easy way to
generate html. It converts regular Clojure data structures right into
html. For example,

```clojure
[:p "Hello, " [:i "doctor"] " Jones."]
```

becomes

```html
<p>Hello, <i>doctor</i> Jones.</p>
```

but it also does two extra handy bits of magic:

  * it provides some CSS-like shortcuts for specifying id and class,
    and

  * it automatically unpacks seqs for you, for example:

    ```clojure
    [:p '("a" "b" "c")]
    ;; expands to (and so, is the same as if you wrote)
    [:p "a" "b" "c"]
    ```

For more info, see:

  * [the Hiccup readme](https://github.com/weavejester/hiccup#readme)
  * [its wiki docs](https://github.com/weavejester/hiccup/wiki)
  * [its API docs](http://weavejester.github.com/hiccup/)



### H2

[H2](http://www.h2database.com/html/main.html) is a small and fast Java SQL
database that could be embedded in your application or run in server
mode. Uses single file for storage, but also could be run as in-memory DB.

> Another similar Java-based embedded DB that could be used in your
> application is [Apache Derby](http://db.apache.org/derby/).



## Create and set up your project

Create your new webapp project like so:

```bash
lein new compojure my-webapp
cd my-webapp
```

Add the following extra dependencies to your project.clj's
`:dependencies` vector:

```clojure
[hiccup "1.0.5"]
[org.clojure/java.jdbc "0.6.0"]
[com.h2database/h2 "1.4.193"]
```

(You might also remove the `-SNAPSHOT` from the project's version
string.)


## Add some styling

```bash
mkdir -p resources/public/css
touch resources/public/css/styles.css
```

and put into that file something like:

```css
body {
    background-color: Cornsilk;
}

#header-links {
    background-color: BurlyWood;
    padding: 10px;
}

h1 {
    color: CornflowerBlue;
}
```



## Set up your database

A file with DB would be automatically created when you connect to it for the
first time, so all necessary DB preparations could be done programmatically
using the REPL (with help of `clojure.java.jdbc`):

```bash
lein repl
```

Execute the following code to create a new my-webapp.h2.db database file in db
subdirectory of your project, create a table we'll use for our webapp, and add
one record to start us off with:

```clojure
(require '[clojure.java.jdbc :as jdbc])
(jdbc/with-db-connection [conn {:dbtype "h2" :dbname "./my-webapp"}]

  (jdbc/db-do-commands conn
    (jdbc/create-table-ddl :locations
      [[:id "bigint primary key auto_increment"]
       [:x "integer"]
       [:y "integer"]]))

  (jdbc/insert! conn :locations
    {:x 8 :y 9}))
```

and hit `ctrl-d` to exit.

For more about how to use the database functions, see the
[Using java.jdbc](/articles/ecosystem/java_jdbc/home/) on this site.



## Set up your routes

In the default `src/my_webapp/handler.clj` file you're provided, we
specify our webapp's *routes* inside the `defroutes` macro. That is,
we assign a function to handle each of the url paths we'd like to
support, and then at the end provide a "not found" page for any other
url paths.

Make your handler.clj file look like this:

```clojure
(ns my-webapp.handler
  (:require [my-webapp.views :as views] ; add this require
            [compojure.core :refer :all]
            [compojure.route :as route]
            [ring.middleware.defaults :refer [wrap-defaults site-defaults]]))

(defroutes app-routes ; replace the generated app-routes with this
  (GET "/"
       []
       (views/home-page))
  (GET "/add-location"
       []
       (views/add-location-page))
  (POST "/add-location"
        {params :params}
        (views/add-location-results-page params))
  (GET "/location/:loc-id"
       [loc-id]
       (views/location-page loc-id))
  (GET "/all-locations"
       []
       (views/all-locations-page))
  (route/resources "/")
  (route/not-found "Not Found"))

(def app
  (wrap-defaults app-routes site-defaults))
```

Each of those expressions in `defroutes` like `(GET ...)` or `(POST ...)` are
so-called "routes". They each evaluate to a function that
takes a ring request hashmap and returns a response hashmap. Your
`views/foo` function's job is to return that response hashmap, but note
that Compojure is kind enough to make a suitable response map out of
any html you return.

So, all you actually need to do now is write your views functions to
return some html.

Incidentally, note the special destructuring that Compojure does for
you in each of those routes. It can pull out url query (and body)
parameters, as well as pieces of the url path requested, and hand them
to your views functions. Read more about that at [Compojure
destructuring](https://github.com/weavejester/compojure/wiki/Destructuring-Syntax).




## Create your Views

Create a `src/my_webapp/views.clj` file and make it look like:

```clojure
(ns my-webapp.views
  (:require [my-webapp.db :as db]
            [clojure.string :as str]
            [hiccup.page :as page]
            [ring.util.anti-forgery :as util]))

(defn gen-page-head
  [title]
  [:head
   [:title (str "Locations: " title)]
   (page/include-css "/css/styles.css")])

(def header-links
  [:div#header-links
   "[ "
   [:a {:href "/"} "Home"]
   " | "
   [:a {:href "/add-location"} "Add a Location"]
   " | "
   [:a {:href "/all-locations"} "View All Locations"]
   " ]"])

(defn home-page
  []
  (page/html5
   (gen-page-head "Home")
   header-links
   [:h1 "Home"]
   [:p "Webapp to store and display some 2D (x,y) locations."]))

(defn add-location-page
  []
  (page/html5
   (gen-page-head "Add a Location")
   header-links
   [:h1 "Add a Location"]
   [:form {:action "/add-location" :method "POST"}
    (util/anti-forgery-field) ; prevents cross-site scripting attacks
    [:p "x value: " [:input {:type "text" :name "x"}]]
    [:p "y value: " [:input {:type "text" :name "y"}]]
    [:p [:input {:type "submit" :value "submit location"}]]]))

(defn add-location-results-page
  [{:keys [x y]}]
  (let [id (db/add-location-to-db x y)]
    (page/html5
     (gen-page-head "Added a Location")
     header-links
     [:h1 "Added a Location"]
     [:p "Added [" x ", " y "] (id: " id ") to the db. "
      [:a {:href (str "/location/" id)} "See for yourself"]
      "."])))

(defn location-page
  [loc-id]
  (let [{x :x y :y} (db/get-xy loc-id)]
    (page/html5
     (gen-page-head (str "Location " loc-id))
     header-links
     [:h1 "A Single Location"]
     [:p "id: " loc-id]
     [:p "x: " x]
     [:p "y: " y])))

(defn all-locations-page
  []
  (let [all-locs (db/get-all-locations)]
    (page/html5
     (gen-page-head "All Locations in the db")
     header-links
     [:h1 "All Locations"]
     [:table
      [:tr [:th "id"] [:th "x"] [:th "y"]]
      (for [loc all-locs]
        [:tr [:td (:id loc)] [:td (:x loc)] [:td (:y loc)]])])))
```

Here we've implemented each function used in `handler.clj`.

Again, note that each of the functions with names ending in "-page"
(the ones being called in `handler.clj`) is returning just a plain
string consisting of html markup. In handler.clj's `defroutes`,
Compojure is helpfully taking care of placing that into a response
hashmap for us.

Rather than clog up this file with database-related calls, we've put
them all into their own `db.clj` file (described next).



## Create some db access functions

Create a `src/my_webapp/db.clj` file and make it look like:

```clojure
(ns my-webapp.db
  (:require [clojure.java.jdbc :as jdbc]))

(def db-spec {:dbtype "h2" :dbname "./my-webapp"})

(defn add-location-to-db
  [x y]
  (let [results (jdbc/insert! db-spec :locations {:x x :y y})]
    (assert (= (count results) 1))
    (first (vals (first results)))))

(defn get-xy
  [loc-id]
  (let [results (jdbc/query db-spec
                            ["select x, y from locations where id = ?" loc-id])]
    (assert (= (count results) 1))
    (first results)))

(defn get-all-locations
  []
  (jdbc/query db-spec "select id, x, y from locations"))
```

Note that `jdbc/query` returns a seq of maps. Each map
entry's key is a column name (as a Clojure keyword), and its value is
the value for that column.

You'll also notice that we used a plain string in `get-all-locations`,
rather than putting it in a vector. `java.jdbc` allows us to omit the vector
wrapping when we have a simple SQL query with no parameters.

Of course, you can try out all these calls yourself in the REPL,
if you like:

```
~/temp/my-webapp$ lein repl
...
user=> (require 'my-webapp.db)
nil
user=> (ns my-webapp.db)
nil
my-webapp.db=> (jdbc/query db-spec
          #_=>     "select x, y from locations where id = 1")
({:y 9, :x 8})
```

## Run your webapp during development

You can run your webapp via lein:

    lein ring server

It should start up and also open a browser window for you pointed at
<http://localhost:3000>. You should be able to stop the webapp by
hitting `ctrl-c`.

If you don't want it to automatically open a
browser window, run it like so:

    lein ring server-headless


## Deploy your webapp

To make your webapp suitable for deployment, make the following
changes:


### Changes in project.clj

In your `project.clj` file:

  * add to `:dependencies` (the version should generally match `compojure`s version):

    ```clojure
    [ring/ring-jetty-adapter "1.5.1"] ; e.g., for compojure version 1.5.1
    ```

  * and also add `:main my-webapp.handler`


### Changes in handler.clj

In `src/my_webapp/handler.clj`:

  * in your `ns` macro:
      * add `[ring.adapter.jetty :as jetty]` to the `:require`, and
      * add `(:gen-class)` to the end

The `ns` form should now look like this:

```clojure
(ns my-webapp.handler
  (:require [my-webapp.views :as views]
            [compojure.core :refer :all]
            [compojure.route :as route]
            [ring.adapter.jetty :as jetty] ; add this require
            [ring.middleware.defaults :refer [wrap-defaults site-defaults]])
  (:gen-class)) ; and add this gen-class
```

  * and at the bottom, add the following `-main` function:

    ~~~clojure
    (defn -main
      [& [port]]
      (let [port (Integer. (or port
                               (System/getenv "PORT")
                               5000))]
        (jetty/run-jetty #'app {:port  port
                                :join? false})))
    ~~~


### Build and Run it

Now create an uberjar of your webapp:

```
lein uberjar
```

And now you can run it directly:

    java -jar target/my-webapp-0.1.0-standalone.jar 8080

(or on whatever port number you wish). If you run the JAR file from another
folder, remember to copy the `my-webapp.mv.db` file to that folder!

_NOTE: if you did not remove "-SNAPSHOT" from the project's version string
when you first edited `project.clj`, then the JAR file will have `-SNAPSHOT`
in its name._
