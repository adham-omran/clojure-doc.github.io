# Usage

## Type Aliases

`clojure.core.typed/def-alias` defines a type alias.

```clojure
(def-alias Term (I IUnifyTerms
                   IUnifyWithNil
                   IUnifyWithObject
                   IUnifyWithLVar
                   IUnifyWithSequential
                   IUnifyWithMap
                   IUnifyWithSet
                   IReifyTerm
                   IWalkTerm
                   IOccursCheckTerm
                   IBuildTerm))
```

## Primitive Java Arrays

"Typed" arrays can be created with `into-array>`, which has a 2 and 3 arity version.

The correspondence between core.typed types and Java types is subtle here. Usually
`into-array>` accepts a core.typed type as its first argument, followed by a collection (as `clojure.core/into-array`).

```clojure
;; `int` is the primitive int in Java. This creates a primitive array.
(class (into-array> int [1]))
;=> [I

;; This is a Number array with nullable elements.
(class (into-array> (U nil Number) [1]))
;=> [Ljava.lang.Number;

;; This is a Number array with non-nullable elements.
;; Notice this generates the same type as before as Java does not distinguish
;; non-/nullable arrays. core.typed statically disallows nil to be added
;; as an element from any Clojure it checks.
(class (into-array> Number [1]))
;=> [Ljava.lang.Number;

;; An array of nullable primitive ints does not make sense in Java,
;; so it is generalised to an array of Objects.
(class (into-array> (U nil int) [1]))
;=> [Ljava.lang.Object;

;; Unions are often generalised to Object
(class (into-array> (U clojure.lang.Symbol Number) [1]))
;=> [Ljava.lang.Object;
```

When more control is needed of the Java type, the 3 arity version of `into-array>` accepts
the Java type (in core.typed syntax) as first argument, followed by the Clojure type, and the collection.

```clojure
;; Generalising to Number instead of Object.
(class (into-array> Number (U Integer Number) [1]))
;=> [Ljava.lang.Number;
```

The Clojure element type should be a subtype to the Java element type.

## Declarations

`clojure.core.typed/declare-types`, `clojure.core.typed/declare-names` and `clojure.core.typed/declare-protocols` are similar
to `declare` in that they allow you to use types before they are defined.

```clojure
(declare-datatypes Substitutions)
(declare-protocols LVar)
(declare-names MyAlias)
```

## Checking typed namespaces

`clojure.core.typed/check-ns` checks the namespace that its symbol argument represents.

```clojure
(check-ns 'my.ns)
```

## Debugging

`clojure.core.typed/print-env` prints the current environment.

```clojure
(let [a 1]
  (print-env "Env:")
  a)
; Prints: "Env:" {:env {a (Value 1)},  ....}
```

`clojure.core.typed/cf` (pronounced "check form") can be used at the REPL to return the type of a form.

```clojure
(cf 1)
;=> [(Value 1) {:then [top-filter], :else [bot-filter]} empty-object]
```

## Macros & Macro Definitions

Macro definitions are ignored. The type checker operates on the macroexpanded form from
the Compiler's analysis phase.
